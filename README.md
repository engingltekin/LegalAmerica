# Legal and General America
Build an .Net Core and Code First Entity Framework Application

# NOTES

1. Tried to simulate an insurance company data model
2. Did not try to create complex view models since that was not the goal.
3. Kept UI, Service and Repository layer separate. Service layer and repository layer looks identical, However service layer is a middleware for building complex types before passing to UI, and composing data before passing to repository. 
4. Used both Data Annotations and Fluent Validation for Model validations. 
5. Placed a Javascript file to show Javascript capabilities personList.js under wwwroot. 
6. Used Docker Containers
