# Legal and General America
Build a Simple .Net Core and Code First Entity Framework Application. 
Purpose of writing a small application is to display depth of knowledge. 
Purpose is not to create perfect bug free, fully functional and tested code.

# NOTES

1. Tried to keep sample data models similar to Real Life Insurance Company.  
2. Did not try to create complex view models since that was not the goal. 
3. Kept UI, Service and Repository layer separate. Service layer and repository layer looks identical, However service layer is a middleware for building complex types before passing to UI, and composing data before passing to repository. 
4. Used both Data Annotations and Fluent Validation for Model validations. 
5. Placed a Javascript file to show Javascript capabilities personList.js under wwwroot. 
6. Used Docker Containers
7. Did not write test for each scenario.
8. Used third party libraries to show comfortable to understand and consume libraries.
